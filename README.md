# MASONplus9TemplateProject
 MASON+9 template project for Visual Studio Code

## Description

This is a template project modified from one of Prof Jeff Schank's provided MASON project files.

## System that this was tested on:

- Visual Studio Code - Java Extension Pack
- Java Development Kit 17

Eclipse and some older version of Java (above 8) should still work with these codes.

## General TODOs:

1. Change the Project name of both ProjectNameHere folders.

1. Change the project name in the file: ".project"

1. Change the package name of PackageNameHere

1. Import dependencies: MASON and MASON+9. [here is my modified MASON library.](https://github.com/CAWorks-ChrisA/MASONplus9Bundle_CAWorks)

## How to use (Visual Studio Code):

1. Clone this Repository, or, Download it as ZIP. Code -> Download ZIP. Extract the folder and put it in your favorite place.

1. In file explorer, change the Project name of both ProjectNameHere 

1. Open the first "ProjectNameHere" folder in Visual Studio Code.

1. modify ".project", change the project name to your project name.

1. right click on an empty spot of the VSCode file explorer -> Add Folder to Workspace. OR: File -> Add Folder to Workspace

1. Add your MASON and MASON+9 folders into the workspace, either from other sources or from [my modified MASON library](https://github.com/CAWorks-ChrisA/MASONplus9Bundle_CAWorks)

1. Open one of the .java files under src/PackageNameHere. 

1. Let the Java plug-in and the Java Project Manager build the project

1. Change the name of the package using the VSC Java Project Manager: open your project in it, right click on the package: Rename, and let the plugin refactor the code for you.

1. Program your Agent Based Models.

## Known Issues

- Previously Visual Studio Code for MacOS didn't have good compatibility with this template, but the code was refreshed using Prof Jeff Schank's Project on Eclipse, so it should work.
